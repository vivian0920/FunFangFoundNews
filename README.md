❖​ Feature 

1.Use google news of Taiwan and American as our search engine 
 To ensure that all the results are news, we use google news as our search engine. However, google news is differentiated by region, we not only use the Taiwan google news but American google news to make our results more international.  
2.Including time factor 
Normally, people don’t  want to see the outdated news. Therefore, the news has timeliness. To put it into consideration, we estimate the distance of time, the closer to the search day is, the higher score will be. Furthermore, we consider time factor is more important than keyword occurrences by setting  the different scores . 3.Sub-sub pages 
 Because every website has different typography. We get the two sub-pages of the relevant links below in the six indicator media platforms like三立 udn…. Thirdly, the score of the sub-page will be added to the parent page.  At last, the more relevant the sub-page and the keyword are, the higher the score will be.
